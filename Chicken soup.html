    <h2>CHICKEN SOUP INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>

<li>Garlic- fresh garlic cloves!</li>
<li>Ginger- use ginger root or ground ginger in a pinch.</li>
<li>Vegetables: Celery and carrots, or feel free to add other veggies like mushrooms, or other veggies.</li>
<li>Chicken broth (store-bought or homemade) or chicken bouillon or low-sodium chicken broth.</li>
<li>Chicken: skinless chicken breast, skinless chicken thighs, bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN SOUP (INSTRUCTIONS)</h2>
Step 1. This flavorful soup starts with sauteing onion, garlic and ginger until tender
 and fragrant and golden. Sometimes I’ll add celery and carrots, sometimes not.  I like 
 to add a lot of garlic, feel free to cut back if you want.<br>

TIP: if using bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, sear the skin side until deeply golden 
in the pot first. This adds lovely flavor, depth, and collagen to the soup. Remove the
 thighs and saute the onion, garlic and ginger.<br>



Step 2. Add the chicken stock (or broth) and whole chicken thighs (or chicken breasts).
 Bring to a simmer and cover, cooking until the thighs are cooked through, about 20 minutes.
  Bone-in will take longer.<br>

TIP: If adding rice or quinoa, you could add directly to the pot of simmering broth,
 only adding about 1/2 cup. Same with canned beans- just add one can, drained.<br>

I prefer to keep my rice or noodles separate, to prevent the soup from getting cloudy,
 but do as you like.<br>

<b>Place the chicken in the broth raw</b><br>
Step 3. Simmer covered for 20 minutes, more or less depending on size of the chicken pieces.<br>

Step 4. Use two forks or tongs, and pull apart the chicken. You can do this in the pot,
 or use a cutting board if using bone-in chicken. Return the chicken (discarding bones and skin)
  to the pot and bring to a simmer for 3 minutes. Taste and adjust the broth. Squeeze with lemon 
  to taste.<br>

<b>CHICKEN SOUP VARIATIONS:</b><br>
Pasta or noodles: Add leftover pasta or noodles from the pantry, like egg noodles,
 orzo, rice noodles, linguini or even spaghetti. It’s a great way to use up stray
  bags of half-used noodles.<br>
Grains: Add cooked quinoa, millet, rice, or farro at the end of cooking.<br>
Beans: Add can of white beans or lentils or cannellini beans for more fiber.<br>
Veggies:  Toss in diced carrots, celery, mushrooms, or leeks (to the simmering broth)
 or add baby spinach at the end and drizzle it with sesame oil and sprinkle with scallions
  and call it good.<br>
Creamy Chicken Soup: If you like some creaminess, stir in some coconut milk at the very end.
 Adjust salt and lemon to taste.<br><br>
