    <h2>HOW TO MAKE CHICKEN FAJITAS</h2><br>
Once you’ve made your fajita seasoning, the chicken fajitas come together fast.
 Just follow these simple steps:<br>

* Season the chicken. Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides
 of the chicken and use your fingers to press it in.<br>
* Cook the chicken. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and
 lightly coat it with a drizzle of olive oil or avocado oil.
  Sear the chicken breasts for about 7-8 minutes on each side.
   Then remove them from the pan and let them rest for a few
    minutes before slicing into strips.<br>
*Saute the bell peppers and onion. While the chicken is cooking,
 cut the bell peppers and onions into thin slices. Then saute them
  in the same skillet over medium heat for a few minutes until caramelized.
   You’re essentially making fajita veggies.<br>
* Mix together. Add the chicken back into the skillet, squeeze fresh
 lime juice on top and stir everything together.<br>
Wrap it up. Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings.<br>

<h2>CUSTOMIZE YOUR CHICKEN FAJITAS</h2>
<p>While chicken fajitas taste great on their own, 
toppings can make all the difference. From a dollop of
 sour cream to cheese or avocado slices, fajitas are a fun
 way to serve customizable options for your family or a
  large party! A few of my favorite toppings are pico de gallo and guacamole.</p>

<p>And if you’ve got some chicken fajitas leftover, 
don’t limit yourself to just wrapping them in tortillas.
 You can use butter lettuce to make lettuce wraps for a lighter option.
  Or, you can throw them in a bowl with some leafy greens, black beans,
   sweet corn and avocado for an easy fajita salad.</p>
