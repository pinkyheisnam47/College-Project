<h2>Chicken Marinade:</h2>

▢¾ cup Yogurt or hung curd<br>
▢¼ cup Tomato Puree<br>
▢¼ cup Vegetable Oil<br>
▢1 tablespoon Ginger Garlic Paste minced ginger and garlic<br>
▢1 tablespoon Red Chilli Powder sub with 1 teaspoon Paprika 
+ 1 teaspoon Cayenne<br>
▢1 teaspoon Turmeric Powder<br>
▢1 teaspoon Garam Masala Powder<br>
▢2 tablespoon Brown Onions<br>
▢1 ¼ teaspoon Salt<br><br>
<h2>Saffron:</h2>
▢2 tablespoon Hot Milk<br>
▢10-15 Saffron strands<br>
Parboiled Rice (70% cooked):
▢2 cups Basmati Rice Note 3<br>
▢6 cups Water<br>
▢2 tablespoon Salt<br>
▢1 Bayleaf<br>
▢5-6 Cloves<br>
▢2-3 Cardamom Pods<br>
Other Biryani Ingredients:
▢1 cup Mint Leaves fresh<br>
▢1 cup Coriander Leaves Cilantro<br>
▢1 ½ tablespoons Ghee or Butter<br><br>
<h2>To Serve:</h2>
▢Crispy Brown Onions<br>
▢Onion Raita<br><br>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>To make the brown onions, pat the onions dry and if time permits,
 leave them out on a kitchen towel for 15-20 minutes to dry them 
 out slightly. Heat oil in a pan and add the onions. On a medium
  flame, shallow fry the onions for 15 minutes till they are a
   deep golden brown, without burning them. Drain them out on a 
   paper towel, and set aside. These can be made ahead and stored 
   in an air tight container overnight. Burnt onions will add
    a bitter flavor to the biryani. You can also use store
     bought fried onions/ shallots which are easily available
      in leading supermarkets, Indian and Asian stores.</p>

<p>Mix together all the ingredients under chicken marinade 
    and marinate for at least two hours or overnight for best results.</p>
<p>When you are ready to make the biryani, soak saffron strands in hot milk 
    and rub them slightly with the back of a spoon. Set this aside.</p>
<p>Bring water to a roaring boil and add salt, whole spices and basmati rice. 
    Cook for exactly 5 minutes and drain completely, leaving the whole spices 
    in the rice. This will cook the rice to about 70% doneness which can be checked
     by pressing a grain of rice between two fingers - the rice should still
      be raw in the middle.</p>
<h2>Layering and Cooking Chicken Biryani:</h2> 
<p>Heat a heavy bottomed pot like a dutch oven, and add the chicken 
    to it. Cook for 4 minutes and then turn the chicken pieces once. 
    Cover and cook for another 3 minutes. Turn off the heat. Scatter
     half the onions all over the chicken, and then sprinkle all the 
     coriander and mint leaves. Next layer the rice all over the mint
      and coriander, and in the end drizzle saffron milk and ghee all 
      over the rice. Cover and cook on a low flame for 20 minutes - this
       will help steam the rice, cook it to doneness and cook the chicken.</p>

<p>Once the biryani is cooked, let it rest for 5-10 minutes, and finish by 
    scattering the remaining onions on top. Serve hot digging the spoon 
    deep to get all the layers.</p><br>
