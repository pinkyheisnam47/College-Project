▢ 2 garlic cloves, minced<br>
▢ 1 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons sugar<br>
▢ 2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce<br>
▢ 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil<br>
▢ 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds<br>
▢ 1 large egg<br>
▢ 4 ounces spinach, washed and drained<br>
▢ 4 ounces of dangmyeon (sweet potato starch noodles)<br>
▢ 2 to 3 green onions, cut crosswise into 2 inch long pieces<br>

<h2>Directions<br>
Marinate the beef and mushrooms:</h2>
<p>Put the beef and shiitake mushrooms into a bowl and mix with 1 clove
 of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon sugar, ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper,
  2 teaspoons soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of toasted sesame oil with a
   wooden spoon or by hand. Cover and keep it in the fridge.shiitakejapchae seasoning</p>

<h2>Make the egg garnish (jidan):</h2>
<p>Crack the egg and separate the egg yolk from the egg white. Remove the white stringy stuff (chalaza) from the yolk. Beat in a pinch of salt with a fork.
Add 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil to a heated nonstick pan. Swirl the oil around so it covers the pan, and then wipe off the excess heated oil with a kitchen towel so only a thin layer remains on the pan.
To keep the jidan as yellow as possible, turn off the heat and pour the egg yolk mixture into the pan. Tilt it around so the mixture spreads thinly. Let it cook using the remaining heat in the pan for about 1 minute. Flip it over and let it sit on the pan for 1 more minute.japchae egg garnish
Let it cool and slice it into thin strips.</p>

<h2>Prepare the noodles and vegetables:<br>
Japchae vegetables</h2><br>

- Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the spinach and blanch 
for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then take it out with a slotted spoon
 or strainer. Let the water keep boiling to cook the noodles.<br>
- Rinse the spinach in cold water to stop it from cooking. Squeeze
 it with your hands to remove any excess water. Cut it a few times 
 and put it into a bowl. Mix with 1 teaspoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon
  toasted sesame oil. Put it into a large mixing bowl.<br>
- Put the noodles into the boiling water, cover and cook for 1 minute. 
Stir them with a wooden spoon so they don’t stick together. Cover
 and keep cooking for another 7 minutes until the noodles are soft and chewy.<br>
- Strain and cut them a few times with kitchen scissors. Put the noodles into
 the large bowl next to the spinach. Add 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil,
  1 teaspoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon sugar. Mix well by hand or a wooden
   spoon. This process will season the noodles and also keep the noodles
    from sticking to each other.<br>
- Heat up a skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil
 with the onion, the green onion, and a pinch of salt. Stir-fry about
  2 minutes until the onion looks a little translucent. Transfer to the noodle bowl.<br>
- Heat up the skillet again and add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil. Add the
 white mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Stir-fry for 2 minutes until 
 softened and a little juicy. Transfer to the noodle bowl.<br>
- Heat up the skillet and add 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Add the carrot 
and stir-fry for 20 seconds. Add the red bell pepper strips and stir-fry 
another 20 seconds. Transfer to the noodle bowl.<br>
- Heat up the skillet and add 2 teaspoons vegetable oil.
 Add the beef and mushroom mixture and stir fry for a few 
 minutes until the beef is no longer pink and the mushrooms
  are softened and shiny. Transfer to the noodle bowl.japchae beef<br><br>
